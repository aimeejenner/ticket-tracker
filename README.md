## User Story

As an employer I would like to keep track of the number of tickets completed by each member of my team, so that I can monitor team performance.

## Functionality

The app contains two components: Employee and Counter. The Employee component displays the employee name and role as well as the Counter component. Clicking the + or - buttons in the Counter component increments or decrements the count state, which is initially set to 0.

App.jsx displays an Employee component for each employee contained in the employees.js file.
